# tool-packs Agent Guide

Scope: this guide applies to `src/crates/tool-packs`.

`bitfun-tool-packs` currently owns tool feature-group scaffold metadata only.
It does not own concrete tool implementations yet.

## Guardrails

- Keep `default = []`; `product-full` may aggregate feature groups but must not
  silently enable new runtime behavior.
- Do not depend on `bitfun-core`, concrete service crates, app crates, Tauri,
  Git, MCP, network clients, or CLI UI dependencies unless H1 explicitly moves a
  reviewed tool runtime owner here.
- Do not own manifest/exposure contracts, runtime manifest assembly,
  `GetToolSpec` execution, collapsed unlock state, snapshot decoration, or
  `ToolUseContext`.
- Future concrete tool migration must preserve product registry order,
  expanded/collapsed exposure, prompt stubs, unlock state, cancellation, runtime
  restrictions, and Deep Review tool flow.

## Verification

```bash
cargo test -p bitfun-tool-packs --features basic
cargo check -p bitfun-tool-packs --features product-full
node scripts/check-core-boundaries.mjs
```
